    <h3>Managements</h3>
    Admins can create and administrate several different managements.<br>
    The clone button helps defining new managements by copying the data from existing ones.
    Before saving at least one of the parameters Hostname, Port or Config Path has to be different from the existing managements if the Import Disabled flag is not set.<br>
    Parameters:
    <ul>
        <li>Name*: Name of the Mangement. Names ending with "_demo" will be deleted when using the "Remove Sample Data" button</li>
        <li>Comment:</li>
        <li>Device Type*: Out of a list of available types, e.g. Checkpoint R8x or Fortinet 5.x</li>
        <li>Hostname*: Address of the host (either IP address or resolvable name). 
            For Check Point R8x MDS installations use the address of the MDS server for all domains.</li>
        <li>Port*: Port number of the host</li>
        <li>Import User*: the user used to login to the firewall management. On Check Point R8x we recommend using the predefined "Read Only All" profile (both global and domain management) for the user.</li>
        <li>Login Secret*:</li>
        <li>Public Key:</li>
        <li>Config Path: Path of the config file. 
            For Check Point R8x MDS installations, the Domain name needs to be given here.</li>
        <li>Importer Hostname: This must be the name of the server, the import process should run on. 
            Needs to be individually configured if you want to have multiple distrivuted import modules, 
            so that not every importer imports all managements..</li>
        <li>Debug Level (0-9):</li>
        <li>Import Disabled: Flag if the data import is disabled</li>
        <li>Force Initial Import:</li>
        <li>Hide in UI:</li>
    </ul>
    If there are sample data (defined by the ending "_demo" of the name), a button is displayed to delete them and all related <a href="/help/settings/gateways">gateways</a>.
