# meeting minutes

## past week's changes
- scheduler non-admin role issues
- pwd change (admin, user pre-login)
- re-write cp-r8x importer --> prepare for inline-layer
- various UI fixes (section header, template collapse, ...)

## project mgmt
- milestone v1.5 - 2021-05-31
- website support talks on Thursday
- demo presentation on Tuesday/Wednesday
- Use GitHub feature Releases / Packages, Design: Decide on git version management
- define support strategy

## design
- brainstorming recertification process --> <https://xfer.cactus.de/index.php/apps/drawio/138065>
  - recertification responsibility for a rule / rule ownership: requester, request approver in workflow, destination service owner, client ip owner (or user!) 
- inline layer handling
  - displaying policies as similiar to CP UI as possible
  - store the rule/(sub-)policy data in DB
  - allow for correct interpretation of rule parsing in all modules (starting with filtering)
  - make sure the layers get sorted out correctly (layer in layer vs. two layers on the same level)

## next steps
- focus on bugs
- additional features needed:
  - export reports (change report, statistics, ...)
  - issue #504 use (external) ldap group within roles, always need to resolve group during login, never store passwords or ext. group content locally!

## decisions / sessions
