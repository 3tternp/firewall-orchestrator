# meeting minutes

## past week's changes
- universal upgrade folder (yml) exists for each role (tested)
- bug at customer with cp r8x - related to domain policies not inline layers - workaround to be tested, parser to be enhanced, demo MDM machine exists
- translation started

## project mgmt
- milestone status 89% phase 1.5
- start of 1.9
- document project structure to help navigating/finding the relevant piece of code 
- document (settings gateway/mgmt) functionality in help pages
- PR quote received - will be ordered this week, brighttalk contact, presentation

## design
- documentation of api / help page structure topic
  - what to have publicly accessible (just put the api docu on fwo.cactus.de?)
  - how to deal with requirement to have help info in separate window vs. session information (not all users see the same menu structure) 
- brainstorming recertification process --> <https://xfer.cactus.de/index.php/apps/drawio/138065>
  - recertification responsibility for a rule / rule ownership: requester, request approver in workflow, destination service owner, client ip owner (or user!) 
- layer handling (domain/global rules, sections, inline layer)
  - displaying policies as similiar to CP UI as possible
  - store the rule/(sub-)policy data in DB
  - allow for correct interpretation of rule parsing in all modules (starting with filtering)
  - make sure the layers get sorted out correctly (layer in layer vs. two layers on the same level)
  - --> defining relations (owner/app/rule) in separate table see issue #885

## next steps
- focus on bugs
- additional features needed:
  - export reports (change report, statistics, ...), objects are missing: see issue #891 - discuss plan
  - issue #504 use (external) ldap group within roles, always need to resolve group during login, never store passwords or ext. group content locally!

## decisions / sessions

## presentations (April/May)
- Nils to prepare short workshop on c# issues
  - force rendering (when to use StateHasChanged, ...)
  - async tasks
- Yannik to show 2FA for github
- source code structure review and optimization (worst case: documentation ;-)
- Achim to present UI form grid functionality
