# meeting minutes

## past week's changes
- universal upgrade folder (yml) exists for each role (tested)
- translation started
- missing feature at customer (CP r8x domain rules) - demo MDM machine exists, reproducible, combining with inline layer issue #191
- rule report export with objects completed
- external ldap AD completed?

## project mgmt
- milestone status 89% phase 1.5
- start of 1.9
- document (settings gateway/mgmt) functionality in help pages
- PR quote received - will be ordered this week, brighttalk contact, presentation
- document project structure to help navigating/finding the relevant piece of code 

## design
- documentation of api / help page structure topic
  - what to have publicly accessible (just put the api docu on fwo.cactus.de?)
  - how to deal with requirement to have help info in separate window vs. session information (not all users see the same menu structure) 
- brainstorming recertification process --> <https://xfer.cactus.de/index.php/apps/drawio/138065>
  - recertification responsibility for a rule / rule ownership: requester, request approver in workflow, destination service owner, client ip owner (or user!) 
- layer handling (domain/global rules, sections, inline layer)
  - displaying policies as similiar to CP UI as possible
  - store the rule/(sub-)policy data in DB
  - allow for correct interpretation of rule parsing in all modules (starting with filtering)
  - make sure the layers get sorted out correctly (layer in layer vs. two layers on the same level)
  - --> defining relations (owner/app/rule) in separate table see issue #885

## next steps
- focus on bugs, start 1.9 issues as well

## decisions / sessions

## presentations

- Achim to present UI form grid functionality
