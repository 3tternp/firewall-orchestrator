## design
- layer handling (domain/global rules, sections, inline layer)
  - displaying policies as similiar to CP UI as possible
  - store the rule/(sub-)policy data in DB
  - allow for correct interpretation of rule parsing in all modules (starting with filtering)
  - make sure the layers get sorted out correctly (layer in layer vs. two layers on the same level)
  - --> defining relations (owner/app/rule) in separate table see issue #885
