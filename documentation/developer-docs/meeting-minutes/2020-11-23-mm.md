# meeting minutes

## past week's changes
- Importer 
  - can now import from 
    - origin (api, config file on remote host)
    - single config file on importer itself
    - csv files (just the db import)
  - no DB import from customer but using CSV or enriched config files
- Installer
  - reverted upgrade bug
- UI 
  - added 2nd menue level for settings (stub)
  - settings - personal - uiuser language settings (added user permissions in API) - persistent per-user storage of config settings

## issues
- #497 addscoped not working as expected - - each user now has his/her own language setting <https://github.com/CactuseSecurity/firewall-orchestrator/blob/master/roles/ui/files/FWO_UI/Startup.cs>

## decisions
- combining auth-server & scheduler into application-server (to be able to generate ad-hoc JWTs for scheduled user reports giving current user-centric filtering)
- for now not sharing report output (pdf, html, ...) only report template (filter)
  - UI
    - leave this option out: filter - do we need a "only filter on rule level, do not search in rules" option? if so, how do we represent this in a filter line (recursion=no?) 
    - how/where to display filter syntax, currently only on help page
