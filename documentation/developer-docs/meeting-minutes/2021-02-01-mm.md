# meeting minutes

## project mgmt
- betriebsferien?
- issue with debian and symantec certificates --> devsrv(2) broken

## past week's changes
- auth 
  - done: installer/ui settings: add demo install option (auditor) - Achim/Valentin/Tim: issue [#59](https://github.com/CactuseSecurity/firewall-orchestrator/issues/59)
 installer
- starting red hat installer, see <https://github.com/CactuseSecurity/firewall-orchestrator/blob/master/documentation/developer-docs/ansible-redhat.md>
- importer
  - logging (Holger)

## next steps
- reporting right sidebar - objects are currently not fetched correctly
- ext ldap (Valentin), issue #504 add ldap group to role (Valentin) and try to resolve group (Achim) during login, do not resolve group in settings 

## decisions / sessions
- is it wise to delete ldap config dir in every upgrade? but always make sure that /var/run/slapd dir is present
- reporting - right sidebar:  drop report view or all view vs. fully implement both?  
- revisit: db clean-up planning (new import scheduler, keep distributes importers in mind), added rule_metadata to contain all change-independant rule data

## presentations (April/May)
- Nils to prepare short workshop on c# issues
  - force rendering (when to use StateHasChanged, ...)
  - async tasks
- Yannik to show 2FA for github
