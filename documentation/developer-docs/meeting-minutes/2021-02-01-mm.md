# meeting minutes

## project mgmt
- starting wordpress site (internally)

## past week's changes
- auth 
  - ext ldap (Valentin), issue #504 add ldap group to role (Valentin) and try to resolve group (Achim) during login, do not resolve group in settings 
- reporting
  - right sidebar - do not pre-fetch right side bar data nw objects + services + users >2.000)
     --> current default settings lead to only services of one mgmt being fetched. could we get first x objects from all mgmts, all obj types?
- installer
  - starting red hat installer, see <https://github.com/CactuseSecurity/firewall-orchestrator/blob/master/documentation/developer-docs/ansible-redhat.md>
- importer
  - logging (Holger)
  - revisit: db clean-up planning (new import scheduler, keep distributes importers in mind)

## next steps
- installer/ui settings: add demo install option (auditor) - Achim/Valentin/Tim: issue [#59](https://github.com/CactuseSecurity/firewall-orchestrator/issues/59)

## decisions / sessions
- reporting - right sidebar:  drop report view or all view vs. fully implement both?
