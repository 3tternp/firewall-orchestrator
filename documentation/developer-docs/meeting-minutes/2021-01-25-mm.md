# meeting minutes

## project mgmt
- starting wordpress site (internally)

## past week's changes
- auth 
  - ext ldap (Valentin)
  - issue #504 add ldap group to role (Valentin) and try to resolve group (Achim) during login, do not resolve group in settings 
- reporting
  - fixes in report template handling
  - right sidebar (new PR, optimizations needed, new config setting)
    - do not pre-fetch right side bar data nw objects + services + users >2.000)
     --> current default settings lead to only services of one mgmt being fetched. could we get first x objects from all mgmts, all obj types?
  - NullPointerException UserConfig --> issue Yannik
- installer (Valentin)
- importer 
  - logging (Holger)
  - db clean-up planning (new import scheduler, keep distributes importers in mind)

## next steps
- middleware/ldap - review user rights (see also issue #606)
- middleware / report scheduling
- installer/ui settings: add demo install option (auditor) - Achim/Valentin/Tim: issue [#59](https://github.com/CactuseSecurity/firewall-orchestrator/issues/59)

## decisions / sessions
- reporting - right sidebar:  drop report view or all view vs. fully implement both?  

## presentations
- Nils to prepare short workshop on c# issues
  - force rendering (when to use StateHasChanged, ...)
  - async tasks
- Yannik to show 2FA for github
  
## misc
