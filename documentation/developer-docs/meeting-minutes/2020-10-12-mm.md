# meeting minutes

there are a lot of issues (good first issue) to grab

## Development tools
- Holger's VM
- simple copy script as commit replacement for local testing: <https://github.com/CactuseSecurity/firewall-orchestrator/tree/master/documentation/developer-docs>

## past weeks changes
- added more integration tests in ansible
- db installer (shell --> ansible)
- UI: user displayed, autofocus --> show error
- auth: tenants are read
- ldap installer (re-install, upgrade, ...) --> installation_mode switch (see <https://github.com/tpurschke/firewall-orchestrator/blob/master/documentation/installer/install-advanced.md>): 

      Installation mode parameter

      The followin switch can be used to set the type of installation to perform

      ansible-playbook -i inventory -e "installation_mode=upgrade" site.yml -K

      installation_mode options:

          new (default) - assumes that no fworch is installed on the target devices - fails if it finds an installation
          uninstall - uninstalls the product including any data
          upgrade - installs on top of an existing system preserving any existing data in ldap, database, api
