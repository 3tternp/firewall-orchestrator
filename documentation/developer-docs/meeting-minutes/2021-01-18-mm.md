    - collapse left sidebar (>15 devices)
    - do not pre-fetch right side bar data nw objects + services + users >2.000)
- importer (systemd, no upgrade --> new upgrade ansible issue)
- installer (Valentin)

## next steps
- middleware/ldap - review user rights (see also issue #606)
- middleware / report scheduling
- installer/ui settings: add demo install option (auditor) - Achim/Valentin/Tim: issue [#59](https://github.com/CactuseSecurity/firewall-orchestrator/issues/59)

## decisions / sessions
- middleware scheduling: for generating scheduled report, user with roles + tenant (for visible devices + managements) is needed, therefor dn is needed, therefor username + pwd (we dont got those in scheduling task on middleware server)
- middleware: issue #504 add ldap group to role (Valentin) and try to resolve group (Achim) during login, do not resolve group in settings 

## presentations
- Nils to prepare short workshop on c# issues
