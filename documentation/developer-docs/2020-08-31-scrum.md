# scrum meeting minutes

## auth module
- review rbac <https://github.com/CactuseSecurity/firewall-orchestrator/blob/master/documentation/auth/rbac.md>
- login with empty user/pwd for testing (using fake jwt secret, no api connection?)
- users are now searched for in user/operator tree --> can delete (all?) systemusers except for inspector, Manager
  - need to return DN for proper handling in role search, etc. (if two tenants contain the same uid)
  - if same username/pwd combination is found more than once, the first one is returned 
  - need to implement get dev/mgm_id via API for tenant restrictions --> Tim
- role collection --> status?
- currently JWT is stored in Browser Web Storage - SessionStorage --> works only in one tab (security considerations, issue #137)

## UI
- logout functionality implemented
- sample report now working via graphql library
- enter button for login does not work yet (issue #194)
- username needs to be displayed (issue #195)

## basic functionality

need for common functionality for all .net modules identified: <https://github.com/CactuseSecurity/firewall-orchestrator/issues/192>

### config handling (move data from source code to config files/database) 
- config file: see issue <https://github.com/CactuseSecurity/firewall-orchestrator/issues/196>
- ldap_connections: see <https://github.com/CactuseSecurity/firewall-orchestrator/issues/197>
- installer: add hostnames to allow proper distributed installation <https://github.com/CactuseSecurity/firewall-orchestrator/issues/198>

### logging
- all modules log into separate log files in /var/log/fworch
- still need to implement central logging for distr. installations
